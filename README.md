# NIBE Heat Pump Data Visualizer

Visualize CSV exports from NIBE heatpumps to see how your heat pump is performing.

- Charts for energy production, consumption, additional heater usage, and temperatures
- Filter by date range or use quick presets (1/3/12 months)
- Aggregate data daily, weekly, or monthly
- Summary stats: total production/consumption, COP, energy gain, temperatures

Data stays in your browser (localStorage) - nothing is uploaded.

## Usage

1. Export the energy log from your NIBE heatpump
2. Drag and drop the file (or browse)
3. Pick your date range and aggregation level

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
